# CccomboBox

## Introduction

This is a simple project that I made to get familiar with typescript. It has 2 boxes that you can chose a singular item or multiple items.

## How to Use

There should be a link below to open the live project.

=> [Live_Link](https://cccombobox.netlify.app/)

- Just click and select an item
- Or click to "x" button to clear the box.

## Closing Thoughts

I may add keyboard navigation later.
